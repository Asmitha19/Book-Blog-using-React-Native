        title:'The ultimate fantasy of Angels and Shadowhunters.',
        review:"The story follows Clarissa Fray who interacts with a group of Shadowhunters while also discovering her own heritage and her family history. The main theme revolving around each of Cassandra Clare's works is the idea of self-acceptance and coming into one's own in relation to the choices we make and the consequences that follow."
